# PrataCpp
Some of the listings, a few of the chapter reviews, and solutions to most of the exercises in 
S.Prata: "C++ Primer", 6th ed. (2011) 

Disclaimer:  This was my personal training gound and I do not guarantee any success or correctness of code. 
But I believe it helps the novice understand C++ prior up to "C++ 11".

I benefitted greatly from existing solutions on github which stopped short of Chpt 18. So I added that to my collection.

If you start with C++, the wide-spread recommendation is to learn "modern C++". The language's heritage is, however, well 
picked up by books like Prata's.
